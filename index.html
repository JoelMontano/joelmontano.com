                I'm a self taught programmer, currently working in product at
                Microsoft. I also advise Contenda(link) on their growth and GTM
                strategy. Always happy to chat about my experiences in either!
                :) <br /><br />
                I'm not tied to a specific industry and like to keep my
                interests broad. I know many of you have already tabbed out
                cause I'm another lowly "generalist" but I figured I'm too new
                to devote my career to a specific vertical, idk what half of
                them even are yet... One unifying theme is I want to build
                products that are solving hard problems and are easily
                accessible. Professionally, I've just worked in product but I'm
                interested in engineering, growth, and gtm roles as well!
                <br /><br />
                Work stuff aside, I've been a fan of 100t through the "dark
                days", fan of the only relevant sport leagues in the US (I'll
                let you decide which those are) and I'm finally getting back
                into weightlifting and bougie traveling after the pandemic stole
                them from me. I'm always looking to meet and chat with new
                people, don't be afraid to DM me on Twitter if you wanna be
                friends or add me on LinkedIn if don't want me to take 3 months
                to get back to you.

                <p>I'm interested in engineering + engineering-adjacent roles. I'd want to get into the codebase and drive product
                  development but still need a sprinkle of those external + customer facing funcions. Roles such as growth/gtm, customer success,
                  dev advocacy, and product are all interesting to me! Some things I enjoy doing at work: coding, creating technical content, onboarding new customers, conducting 
                user interviews, defining product needs and strategy, ending meetings early, shitposting, abusing custom slack emojis.
